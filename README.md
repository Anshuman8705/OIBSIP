# 🌟 OIBSIP – Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship

This repository contains all the tasks completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte (AICTE Approved)**.

During this internship, I worked on real-world datasets, performed exploratory data analysis, implemented machine learning models, and documented insights across multiple tasks.

## 📌 **Task 1 – Iris Flower Classification**
✔ Built ML model to classify Iris flowers into **Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**  
✔ Performed EDA: pairplot, heatmap, distribution plots  
✔ Trained 3 ML models: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN  
✔ Achieved high accuracy using **SVM (best model)**  
✔ Exported trained model as `.pkl` file  
✔ Implemented fully on **Google Colab**
